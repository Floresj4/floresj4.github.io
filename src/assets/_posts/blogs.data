It's been 6 years and the lenses have accumulated a slight haze. </p><p> Nothing too bad, but why let it worsen...  The first two images show the amount of buildup and the start of the project.  I'll briefly describe the project and include some images. </p><p> The 3M Headlight Restoration Kit consisted of a drill-attachment sanding/buffing pad, masking tape, sand paper (P500 &amp; P800), a 3M Trizact refining disc (P3000), and a protective coating wipe. </p><p> It starts with the P500 disc...  I'll admit, I was worried as soon as the disc touched the lense.  It scratched away enough material to make me doubt the outcome.  Regardless, I continue sanding and wiping until I had a smooth even lense again. </p><p> Another session of sanding and wiping with the P800 follows. </p><p> Next, buffing with the Trizact disc.  This was a clay-like disc which requires the lense surface remain saturated during the buff; science&ndash;magic.  After buffing evenly the headlights are beginning to come back to life, still a bit foggy... </p><p> Lastly, the 3M coating is applied.  Between the Trizact pad and the protective coating, this is where all the magic is.  Any haze which remains is wiped away effortlessly.  It's quite impressive! </p><p class='console'> [Headlight images removed] </p> <p> Added to the backlog... I'll plan to use Flickr or whatever I consider a suitable alternative. </p> </div>"

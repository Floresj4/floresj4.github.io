Suzie is my Subaru, a Silver 2009 Subaru Legacy 2.5i.  I recently came across an opportunity to restore the headlights via product-review & survey which landed me a free kit.  It's been 6 years and her shades have accumulated a slight haze.

Nothing too bad, but why let it worsen...  The first two images show the amount of buildup and the start of the project.  I'll briefly describe what's entailed.

The 3M Headlight Restoration Kit consisted of a drill-attachment sanding/buffing pad, masking tape, sand paper (P500 & P800), a 3M Trizact refining disc (P3000), and a protective coating wipe.

It starts with the P500 disc...  I'll admit, I was worried as soon as the disc touched the lense.  It scratched away enough material to make me doubt the outcome.  Regardless, I continue sanding and wiping until I had a smooth even lense again.

Another session of sanding and wiping with the P800 follows.

Next, a buffing session with the Trizact disc.  This was a clay-like disc which requires the buffing surface remain saturated during the process &ndash; I used a small spray bottle. After buffing evenly the headlights are beginning to come back to life, still a bit foggy...

Lastly, the 3M coating is applied.  Between the Trizact pad and the protective coating, this is where all the magic is.  Any haze which remains is wiped away effortlessly.  It's quite impressive!  The last two images show the result between the Trizact buff and the application of the 3M coating.

The Responsive branch of this project re-styles the original template to be mobile friendly. The new CSS stylings supporting landscape and portrait orientations on 360 and 640 pixel widths and a device pixel ratio of 3.  Chrome Developer tools' device mode was set to a Samsung Galaxy S4.

I opted to create my own CSS stylings instead of using a commercial-public framework, like Bootstrap, to practice Responsive Web Development (RWD) and CSS Media Queries.

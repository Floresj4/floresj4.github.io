The site's style overhaul is complete.  flo.css is out and bootstrap is in.  
flo.css was a small Responsive Web Development (RWD) learning project and the frame of 
floresj4.github.io.  For all the responsive needs it wasn't feasible to try and 
recreate a framework such as bootstrap, but a good opportunity to understand what's 
going on.

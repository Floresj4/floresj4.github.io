I started exploring the <a href='https://angularjs.org' target="_blank">Angular</a> framework and decided to create a small project.  
<a href='http://floresj4.github.io/AngularJS/'>Angular ReST Client</a> combines AngularJS for client-side events and the Java API for ReSTful Web Services (JAX-RS) for server responsibilities - resource management.

Exploring drag-n-drop functionality using Angular components and event binding.  The structural 
directive <code>*ngFor</code> is used to create list-item elements and bind the events necessary to 
support drag-n-drop functionality - <code>(dragstart)</code>, <code>(dragover)</code>, 
and <code>(drop)</code>.  The draggable attribute is also set on each element to ensure
they can be dragged.

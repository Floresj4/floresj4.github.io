I may need this in the future...  This is done at a project level instead of the
entire workspace.

<ul>
	<li>Right-click project -> Properties.</li>
	<li>Validation -> Enable project specific settings.</li>
	<li>Select the ellipsis to add a file to the exclusion group.</li>
	<li>Select the Exclude Group topic and select Add Rule.</li>
	<li>Select the Folder or file name as the filter type and browse for file.</li>
</ul>
